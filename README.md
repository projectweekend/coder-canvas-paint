Canvas Paint for Coder
==================

A simple drawing app, built with [Coder For Raspberry Pi](http://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder/), using the [HTML5 canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas).

You can add **Canvas Paint** to your Coder by creating a new app and choosing to upload the `canvas_paint.zip` file from this repo. The zip file bundles the `app`, `views` and `static` folders from this repo.
